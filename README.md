## Description
<div align="justify">
  This project aims to predict CO2 emissions from various vehicles using the 'Car Fuel & Emissions 2000-2013' dataset. The primary objectives are to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts CO2 emissions based on vehicle data, identify key factors that significantly influence vehicle emissions, determine how engine capacity correlates with CO2 emission, analyze if certain manufacturers and models have better emission standards, predict noise level based on engine capacity, fuel type, and transmission type, evaluate if engine capacity, transmission type, and fuel type can be used to predict fuel efficiency, and evaluate CO2 emissions based on vehicles' model year. The dataset encompasses diverse vehicle specifications, including emissions (CO2, NOx, CO) and noise levels, linked to engine size, fuel type, and compliance standards. The project leverages machine learning techniques to predict emissions and fuel efficiency, contributing to sustainable environmental strategies and better environmental management. The final model selected is the Bagged Decision Trees Regressor, which has the highest R^2 and lowest MSE and MAE, indicating excellent model fit and superior predictive accuracy.
